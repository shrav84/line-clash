I have created and added two versions of the game: one is command line based, another is GUI based. Play per your preference. 

This is just something I tinker on to when I want to clear my head or want a breather from heavy machine learning codes. 

So I advice you do the same and follow me along on this journey to explore as many aspects of this game as programmably possibly. (get it? humanly - programmably? haha, my rotting SOH ;)
